## Hi and welcome to my personal blog.

My name is Ahmed BAHYA, and I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a keen interest in Blue Teaming.

This blog is dedicated to sharing insights into various cybersecurity attacks and threats, along with effective mitigation techniques to prevent them.

If you have a specific attack technique in mind, feel free to send me an email—I’d be happy to write a blog about it as soon as possible.

Enjoy exploring and learning! :)
